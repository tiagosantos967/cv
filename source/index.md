My name is Tiago and I’m a Portuguese robotics engineer, currently living and working in The Netherlands.
As a robotics engineer at Decos, I do a lot of front and back-end development, while being involved in the creation of a startup that is pioneering the field of social-robotics.   

# Work Experience
## [Robotics and Future Technologies Engineer](/decos) at [Decos](https://www.decos.com "Decos' Homepage")
At Decos we are building one of the first robot-receptionist startups that is pioneering the field of social robotics. Here, I work as a full stack Robotics Engineer, and I am currently developing 3 platforms: a robot receptionist (Pepper), a doorman robot (ECO) and a API/WebApplication that manages the integration between all the robots we have (C3PO).

## Research Engineer at [Uninova – CA3](http://ca3-uninova.org "Uninova - CA3's Homepage")
At CA3 I started as an intern and ended as a research engineer. There I helped develop several projects for [ESA](http://www.esa.int/ESA), namely: [IPSIS](http://ca3-uninova.org/project_ipsis), [FUSION](http://ca3-uninova.org/project_fusion) and [AVERT](http://ca3-uninova.org/project_avert).  
My coordinator was Dr. Rita Ribeiro, who was mentored by [Lotfi A. Zadeh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotfi_A._Zadeh "Who is Zadeh?") (Fuzzy Logic author).

## Teaching Assistant at [FCT-UNL](http://www.fct.unl.pt/en "FCT-UNL's Homepage")
During the last year of my Masters I was a teacher assistant for the [course PM (Programação de Micro-processadores)](http://www.unl.pt/guia/2013/fct/UNLGI_getUC?uc=7777) where I assisted 1st year Electrical and Computer Engineering students taking their first steps in C and programming in general.

# Studies
## Master of Electrical and Computer Engineering at [FCT-UNL](http://www.fct.unl.pt/en "FCT-UNL's Homepage")
Specializations in Robotics, Machine Learning (Fuzzy Logic and Artificial Neural Network) and Control Systems.
Thesis: [Land Cover classification using remotely sensed data from Satellite Images and Fuzzy Inference Systems](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7555116/). Implemented mainly in Matlab.
