title: Hello World!
---
My name is Tiago and I’m a Portuguese robotics engineer, currently living and working in The Netherlands. As a CTO at a startup [WELBO](https://www.welbo.eu) I am helping to pioneer the field of social-robotics with one of the first robot receptionists in the Netherlands. On my spare time I like to read about human behavior towards technology and how to integrate it better in our daily lives. I also like to keep up to date with the latest technology trends in order to improve my work. Another interest of mine is the Internet of Things and home automation.

# Work Experience
## CTO at [WELBO](https://www.welbo.eu)
In January of 2018 WELBO was founded from a robotics "Skunk Works" that I started on my previous role.
One of my first duties as CTO was to move our server architecture to the Google Cloud, using Kubernetes clusters.
At the moment I am working on:
* Improving operations in order to deploy our software quicker to new clients;
* Moving more robotics services to the power of Cloud Computing.

## [Robotics and Future Technologies Engineer](/decos) at [Decos](https://www.decos.com "Decos' Homepage")
At Decos I started a social robotics company where I led the development of one of the first robot receptionists in the Netherlands, using modern technologies like ReactJs, NodeJs, Docker Agile and Scrum.
I also worked on the development of our doorman robot, which guides visitors daily at the Decos office. I was also actively involved in the acquisition of the first clients.

## Research Engineer at [Uninova – CA3](http://ca3-uninova.org "Uninova - CA3's Homepage")
At CA3 I started as an intern and left as a research engineer. There I worked on several Machine Learning projects for [ESA](http://www.esa.int/ESA), namely: [IPSIS](http://ca3-uninova.org/project_ipsis), [FUSION](http://ca3-uninova.org/project_fusion) and [AVERT](http://ca3-uninova.org/project_avert).
My coordinator was Dr. Rita Ribeiro, who was mentored by [Lotfi A. Zadeh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotfi_A._Zadeh "Who is Zadeh?") (Fuzzy Logic author).

## Teaching Assistant at [FCT-UNL](http://www.fct.unl.pt/en "FCT-UNL's Homepage")
During the last year of my Masters I was a teacher assistant for the [course PM (Programação de Micro-processadores)](http://www.unl.pt/guia/2013/fct/UNLGI_getUC?uc=7777) where I assisted 1st year Electrical and Computer Engineering students taking their first steps in C and programming in general.

# Studies
## Master of Electrical and Computer Engineering at [FCT-UNL](http://www.fct.unl.pt/en "FCT-UNL's Homepage")
Specializations in Robotics, Machine Learning (Fuzzy Logic and Artificial Neural Network) and Control Systems.
