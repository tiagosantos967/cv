My name is Tiago and I’m a Portuguese robotics engineer, currently living and working in The Netherlands.
As a robotics engineer at Decos, I do a lot of front and back-end development, while being involved in the creation of a startup that is pioneering the field of social-robotics.   

# Work Experience
## Robotics and Future Technologies Engineer at [Decos](https://www.decos.com "Decos' Homepage")
At Decos we are building one of the first robot-receptionist startups that is pioneering the field of social robotics. Here, I work as a full stack Robotics Engineer, and I am currently developing 3 platforms: a robot receptionist (Pepper), a doorman robot (ECO) and a API/WebApplication that manages the integration between all the robots we have (C3PO).
